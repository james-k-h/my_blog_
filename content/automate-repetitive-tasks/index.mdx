Do you enjoy doing the same mind-numbing tasks over and over again?

No? Well I've got a treat for you, stay tuned.

Simple automation is possible either using a low/no code solution, EG: Power Automate,
or a code-based approach, EG: Python script and Windows task scheduler.

One valuable approach might be to read a file, scrape the contents for relevant input, then
output that into an email, output file, or both. Using the requests library, you can leverage the power
of a regex (regular expression) which allows for more sophisticated pattern matching.

<i>A simplistic regex is as follows: </i>

```
import re

phoneNumRegex = re.compile(r'\d\d\d-\d\d\d-\d\d\d\d')
mo = phoneNumRegex.search('My number is 415-555-4242.')

with open('output.txt','a') as f:
  print('Phone number found: ' + mo.group(), file = f)
```

The assumption here is you are already working with a dataset or file.
This will search as per the specified value(s), take the output and push it to the defined file.

You create an object with the compile() method using a raw string, pass this string to the search method,
giving you back a match object. Lastly, call the group() method and pass the output to your holding file to then take further action.

## How do you automate this?

If you are a Windows user, the Task Scheduler is your best friend.
You can use a batch file to easily set up your script to be auto-ran by the system at a defined time.
Making a batch file is very straight-forward, but if you need guidance, check out this reference: https://datatofish.com/batch-python-script/.

Make sure you set your task scheduler triggers as per your needs.

## Here is another basic example

```
from datetime import datetime
import os

def write_file(filename, data):
    if os.path.isfile(filename):
        with open(filename, 'a') as f:
            f.write('\n' + data)
    else:
        with open(filename, 'w') as f:
            f.write(data)

def print_time():
    now = datetime.now()
    current_time = now.strftime("%H:%M:%S")
    data = "Current Time = " + current_time
    return data

write_file('test.txt' , print_time())

```

## Using Other Libraries to Automate

A very useful library for mundane administrative tasks or repetitive data analysis is Pandas.

Essentially, you can read a CSV/Excel file, transform as per your needs, then spit the output out as
another file or use it for something else.

Pandas functions with dataframes, taking the inputted data and creating a table-esque structure (2D, 3D...).

  width="718"

  sizes="100vw"
/>

You can take this and adjust it as per your needs with a variety of built-in methods.

To automate the process end-to-end, you add-in other libraries like OS to manipulate the operating system,
Numpy for dealing with numbers, Glob for reading filepaths and PyWin32 to pull attachments from Outlook (always a classic!).

Finish off by creating a script that will do something like send an email at a prescribed time with your outputted table and you are good to go.

## Low/No-Code - Power Automate

If you aren't comfortable coding and you would like to download an email attachment that you receive weekly,
store it in a specific location on your disk and open it you can use Power Automate to assist.
