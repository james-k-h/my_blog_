So you want to learn to program, good for you.

This is a skillset that has a number of perks but requires a substantial time investment. The ROI, both from a financial but also
from a personal satisfaction perspective can be tremendous, but how does one get started?

> There is a multitude of content that exists on the web to guide you, however not all of it is great.
> How do you determine if a source is credible as a beginner? I would recommend sticking to the big-name companies and institutions: the Googles, Metas, MITs of the world.

Following the advice above will help you establish a nice baseline in regards to the basics in areas like data structures, algorithms, languages, frameworks, databases and so forth.
Take the time to really understand these concepts as these are the building blocks; if you rush this part you will struggle or miss things as you progress.

There are a number of certifications that these groups offer that will cover the above and then extend your knowledge, often culminating in a relevant capstone project.
While none of these programs are perfect, I've found them useful and relatively well designed.

An example of the skills you would develop during one of these course series is as follows:

## Algorithms

One of the places to spend a lot of time one at the start would be algorithms.

It's tempting to skip this piece and jump right into the good stuff, but this is the backbone of
your programming toolkit and not having this will make you far less effective than you would otherwise be.

A great resource to tackle in the early days is "The Algorithm Design Manual" by Steven Skiena (https://www.algorist.com/).

Having this knowledge will assist in problem solving and ensure you are taking the right approach; that your solutions are scalable and robust.

## Next Steps?

Once you have gotten a grasp of the basics, it's time to get your hands dirty.

Choose something that interests you and just code away. Maybe you like data analysis, so go build a Jupyter Notebook.
Maybe you like video games, so learn an applicable language and program away.
Web development is an easy gateway and is the path I personally chose; it allows for creativity and helps you understand all the facets
that go into the WWW as you touch on things like security, networking, development, CI/CD, etc.

Create a repository and just start pushing your code; most importantly, have fun!
