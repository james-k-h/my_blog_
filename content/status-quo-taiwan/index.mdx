<i>Since 2016, tensions have escalated between Taiwan and China. </i>

The election of Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-Wen marked a period in which Taiwan has moved away from enhancing cross-strait ties
with China, which has led to more aggressive Chinese posturing. With the United States guaranteeing Taiwan, we are potentially headed towards to
the first conflict between world powers since the Second World War.

## One China

At the core of this difficulty is China's view of 'One China', or its' manifest destiny to absorb Taiwan, or the unification with the mainland.

In 1992, China believed it reached a consensus with Taiwan, however both parties never agreed on the details of this; further, it was never
intended to solve its' legal status. The current ruling party in Taiwan, the DPP, explicitly rebuke this consensus and since 2019 China has been more
verbose on their intentions for Taiwan, that it must fall under the 'one country, two policies' doctrine. This is the same doctrine which was applied recently
to Hong Kong, during they were given certain political and economic guarantees which ultimately China stifled. At this juncture,
Taiwan explicitly rejects this framework and all political parties are unified on this subject.
