<i>Since 2016, tensions have escalated between Taiwan and China. </i>

The election of Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-Wen marked a period in which Taiwan has moved away from enhancing cross-strait ties
with China, which has led to more aggressive Chinese posturing. With the United States guaranteeing Taiwan, we are potentially headed towards to
the first conflict between world powers since the Second World War.

## One China

At the core of this difficulty is China's view of 'One China', or its' manifest destiny to absorb Taiwan, or the unification with the mainland.

In 1992, China believed it reached a consensus with Taiwan, however both parties never agreed on the details of this; further, it was never
intended to solve its' legal status. The current ruling party in Taiwan, the DPP, explicitly rebuke this consensus and since 2019 China has been more
verbose on their intentions for Taiwan, that it must fall under the 'one country, two policies' doctrine. This is the same doctrine which was applied recently
to Hong Kong, during they were given certain political and economic guarantees which ultimately China stifled. At this juncture,
Taiwan explicitly rejects this framework and all political parties are unified on this subject.

The United States acts as the key stabilizer in this relationship, with the chief goal being peace between nations in the Taiwan Strait.
While it does not explicitly support Taiwanese independence, the US continues to sell defense equipment to the island which is a constant point of contention for China; this position can be termed
as 'strategic ambiguity' or supporting without formally doing so.

As of more recently, the US has been more forthright about its' intentions and President Biden has declared on multiple occasions that if attacked, the US will come
to Taiwan's aid, likely to counterbalance China's continued aggressions in the Strait. There has also been a diplomatic deepening of ties between Taiwan and the US, as US officials are meeting more freely with Taiwanese counterparts;
Taiwanese representatives were also invited to the Presidential Inauguration for the first time. Furthermore, congress has seen a rise in bipartisan support for Taiwan and has proposed a number of legislations
to help bolster Taiwanese defenses and aid in its' inclusion in international organizations.

## Is War on the Horizon?

The goal stated by Xi Jinping is that by 2049 China should be restored to Great Power
status. Part of this journey includes the rapid development of China's military capabilities,
including a concerted effort to revamp the Chinese Navy, transitioning from a brown
water fleet to an deep ocean threat.

China has vastly increased both the quantity and the quality of their navy, recently manufacturing its' first aircraft carriers, one the most important military assets for any modern power.
Not only have they done the aforementioned, but they also continue to improve their logistical and support fleet in tandem, making them a much more dangerous foe than even a decade ago.
The rapid growth of the Chinese navy has been accompanied with an increased assertiveness in the South China Sea, but also the Taiwan Strait.
China routinely violates territorial water limits and flexes its' might, leading to other nations, particularly Japan, to ramp up their defense spending in an unprecedented fashion not seen since the second World War.

Returning to the 2049 'Chinese Dream', an essential element is the fusion of China and Taiwan for Xi. The PLA has made 'contingency planning' for Taiwan a priority and it has been
a major reason for this development. In the absence of war, Chinese assertiveness has manifested in increased patrols and military exercises, cyberattacks and surveillance.
Further, they have restricted tourism while pressuring companies to avoid dealing with Taiwan in an attempt to sabotage them economically, exerting enormous soft influence; they have also tried to punish countries
who have diplomatic ties with Taiwan, for example cutting off trade with Lithuania because they opened a Taiwanese representative office in Vilnius.

The war in Ukraine has likely given pause to overt Chinese aggression as it has highlighted some of the difficulties that would plague a Chinese invasion,
like a lack of logistical sophistication in the same vein as Russia's limitations. The PLA typically resupplies via rail or road, which represents a serious challenge
to an amphibious invasion, nevermind the complexity of a successful amphibious assault. Furthermore, continuing to maintain an effective fleet while dealing with American air and naval superiority presents an extremely difficult hurdle for China to overcome.

Is war eminent? Probably not, as China is watching and learning from the current conflict and will need to continue to develop its' air, sea and cyber profiles.
That being said, there are currently no guarantees that war will not break out at some point.
