<i>Synopsis: </i>

A classic 90s movie, The Usual Suspects is a crime-suspense gem that keeps you engaged the whole way.

The film is a 're-telling' of events pertaining to ever mysterious 'Keyser Soze' as our main character is questioned in a police station; this small-time con
couldn't be anything but, right?

> A rag-tag group of con-men and criminals are brought together to raid an Argentinian drug ship in order
> to repay a debt incurred.

<i>Run-Time: </i> This movie moves at a brisk pace and the 106 minutes of run-time
will be gone in the blink of an eye.

<i>Cast: </i> A very talented cast, headlined by Kevin Spacey do a fantastic job.
Spacey's portrayal is particularly effective.

<i>Plot: </i> This movie has a fantastic plot with one of the best twists in movie
history. The conclusion is one of the finest that Hollywood has delivered.

<i>Cinematography: </i> Very well done.

<i>Overall Rating: </i> Easily top-10 for me, it will always be stapled to my list
of best movies.
