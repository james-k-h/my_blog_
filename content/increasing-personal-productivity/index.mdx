Quite simply, the biggest limitation for me is time.

Given this, I always strive to maximize my day and increase my personal efficiency; here are some of the things that work for me.

### Top 10 Tips

When a heading comes after a paragraph, we need a bit more space, like I already mentioned above. Now let's see what a more complex list would look like.

- **i. Focus on the task at hand**

  I try my best to be as focused as possible on the task I'm preforming; it's better to do one thing very well
  than a number of things poorly.

- **ii. Add in exercise in the AM**

  For me, starting with exercise is critical and sets me up for success.

  When I miss this, I notice a large decrease in energy and mental clarity.

- **iii. Eat properly**

  Eating good quality food consistently throughout the day is key for me.

- **iv. Hit the hardest tasks in the AM**

  Attack the most problematic and difficult things when you are at your best, leave the less important work for later.

- **v. Create a system**

  If you are a compulsive checker, set specific times to do an inbox sweep.

- **vi. Take breaks**

  Routinely taking breaks keeps you fresh and your mind sharp.

- **vii. Make a more impactful to-do list**

  Rather than tackling 50 items, pick 10 high-impact items that will really make a difference.

- **viii. Hold yourself accountable**

  Measure your progress week over week and determine what habits are impeding your success.

- **ix. Block your time**

  Set aside time for specific things to ensure complete coverage.

- **x. Set small daily goals**

  Life is a marathon, try to tackle big goals piecemeal and make daily progress.

I find productivity is essentially being disciplined and setting effective goals, along with establishing healthy routines.
