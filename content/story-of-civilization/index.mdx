<i>Synopsis: </i>

Will Durant covers antiquity until the advent of modern society, looking at key societal areas across the globe.

The 'Story' is a series of volumes, each taking a historical cross-section with an appropriate theme, for example the Reformation.

> In each volume, Durant routinely covers the political, economic, philosophical, religious and cultural developments for specific nations.
> He describes this method as 'synthetic' and it structures his approach to history.

His series is an exhaustive look at Western civilization, from its' infancy onwards, focusing on the big picture themes and developments, occasionally providing
the intimate details to add colour. In his tomes, he focuses on the clash between reason and rationalism against faith; for him
this is the quintessential conflict of all societies.

<i>Read-time: </i> Given this is a series and each volume is fairly dense (roughly
1,000 pages each), Durant's Story is a journey. Read-times will vary but expect to
consume over 10,000 pages before completing the series.

<i>Prose: </i> Durant is a capable writer, occasionally showing brilliance.

<i>Detail: </i> Each volume is a fantastic blend of pertinent facts, while giving
an exhaustive big picture view of what life was like at a specific point in time,
in a specific place.

<i>Overall Rating: </i> I'd give this series 5 stars out of 5, it's one of my personal
favourites.
